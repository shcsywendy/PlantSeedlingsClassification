# PlantSeedlingsClassification
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

## Data descriptions
Data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-seedlings-classification/data
train.csv - the training set, with plant species organized by folder
test.csv - the test set, you need to predict the species of each image
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

## Project Structure
train_dir/: Directory containing training images.
model-best.h5: Saved model weights after training.
## Setup
Data Preparation: Organize your images in a directory (train_dir/) with subdirectories for each class.

## Environment Setup:
Install dependencies using pip:
nginx
Copy
pip install tensorflow numpy keras

## Training the Model
To train the model, execute the Python script included in the project. The training process involves data augmentation for better generalization and uses callbacks like EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to monitor the training process:

ImageDataGenerator is used for real-time data augmentation.
ModelCheckpoint saves the best model based on validation accuracy.
EarlyStopping halts training when the validation accuracy stops improving.

## Configuration
Modify paths in ImageDataGenerator for your setup.
Adjust input_size and classes in unet_model function to match your dataset specifics.

## Evaluation
After training, the model's performance can be evaluated on a separate test set (not provided in the training or validation sets) to check how well it generalizes to new data.
